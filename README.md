Weber-Backend
=============

![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vmalloc/weber-backend.png?branch=master ) 

weber-backend is a Flask application template, intended to get you started with a Flask-powered webapp as quickly as possible. weber-backend includes a database layer through Flask-SQLAlchemy, migrations through Alembic, asynchronous tasks via RQ and Redis, and more.

weber-backend puts an emphasis on ease of deployment (with *ansible*), and not getting in your way while you focus on your actual app logic.

2. Go through the configuration in `flask_app/app.yml` - most configuration options there are self-explanatory, and you might be interested in tweaking them to your needs.

4. Run the test server to experiment:
```
$ python manage.py testserver
```
