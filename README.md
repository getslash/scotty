# Scotty [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/getslash/scotty.png)](https://travis-ci.org/getslash/scotty)
Scotty is a system for retrieving and storing files which need to be deleted after a period of time. At [Infinidat](http://www.infinidat.com/) we use it to store test logs.

We released Scotty is open-source only recently so we still don't have any documentation about it. If this project sounds interesting to you, please subscribe to this repository and the documentation will come soon.
